For first time usage, please install the dependencies using the command:
npm install

To start the project locally, run:
npm start

To update new changes (and deploy to the web), please run this command line (make sure the code has been merged to main):
npm run deploy

NOTE: After each redeployment, always make sure to add the custom domain www.vuanhnguyenduc.com into the "Custom domain" text box, then hit Save. The DNS validation should be successful, and a new build should be triggered for the custom domain. 
Sample:
https://github.com/VuAnhNguyenDuc/VuAnhNguyenDuc.github.io/actions/runs/3853314709

After the build is successful, wait for at least 10 minutes before restarting the page (it takes time for the page to load)
